                Hey there, I&lsquo;m Tapiwa, a tech enthusiast with a flair for
                creativity! ðŸš€ Currently, I am pursuing my Masters in Computer Science
                and juggling my roles as both a developer and student, I&lsquo;m on
                a mission to become a full-stack wizard ðŸ¤“. Over the past 6
                years, I&lsquo;ve been coding in various languages, from crafting web
                applications to building sleek mobile apps ðŸ’»ðŸ“±. But wait,
                there&lsquo;s more! I&lsquo;ve got a thing for blockchain and health tech
                ðŸ’¡. When I&lsquo;m not knee-deep in lines of code, you&lsquo;ll catch me
                immersed in the vibrant universe of art and graphic design ðŸŽ¨
              </p>
              <p className="my-4 font-poppinsLight text-xl justify-center">
                I firmly believe in the transformative potential of technology
                to impact lives, and I am deeply enthusiastic about utilizing my
                skills to bring about positive change. My journey has involved
                active participation in various university competitions, such as
                the Hultz Prize Competition and the Innovation Think Tank at
                Rhodes University. <br />
                <br />
                One notable experience was our participation in a blockchain
                competition, where my friends and I were challenged to devise an
                inventive blockchain solution. Our efforts led us to secure the
                first-place position in the competition. Alongside this, I
                played an integral role in the Sudo-Soc university society.
                Within Sudo-Soc, our focus was on educating fellow students in
                coding, orchestrating coding community events, and coordinating
                hackathons. <br />
                <br />
                Furthermore, I was part of an initiative within Sudo-Soc that
                entailed establishing a computer lab within the local community.
                This endeavor exemplified our commitment to extending the
                benefits of technology beyond the university setting, bridging
                the digital divide, and fostering technological inclusivity
              </p>
              <p className="my-4 font-poppinsLight text-xl justify-center">
                I believe technology is forever changing, as a result of this I
                am not afraid to learn new languages, skills and technologies. I
                am currently researching and experimenting with Blockchain and
                Web3.

                Technology empowers people to do what they want to do. It lets
                people be creative. It lets people be productive. It lets people
                learn things they didn&apos;t think they could learn before, and
                so in a sense, it is all about potential.
